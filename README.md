## Introduction

Pathfinding is a fundamental problem in computer science and robotics, involving finding the most efficient route between two points. This project aims to implement and showcase various pathfinding algorithms, allowing users to compare and understand their differences in terms of efficiency and computational complexity.

## Features

- **Grid Visualization:** View the pathfinding algorithms in action on a visual grid.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Implement and compare popular pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's, A\*, and more.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathfinding-project.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the GUI:**

   - Select a pathfinding algorithm from the dropdown menu.
   - Click and drag to create walls or obstacles on the grid.
   - Place the start and end points by clicking on the respective cells.
   - Press the "Run" button to visualize the algorithm finding the shortest path.

3. **Customize:**
   - Modify the `config.py` file to adjust parameters like grid size, animation speed, etc.
