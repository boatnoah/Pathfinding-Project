## Introduction

Pathfinding is a fundamental problem in computer science, involving finding the most efficient route between two points.

## Features

- **Grid Visualization:** View the pathfinding algorithms in action on a visual grid.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Implement and compare popular pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's, A\*, and more.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathfinding-project.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the GUI:**

   - Select a pathfinding algorithm from the dropdown menu.
   - Click and drag to create walls or obstacles on the grid.
   - Place the start and end points by clicking on the respective cells.
   - Press the "Run" button to visualize the algorithm finding the shortest path.

## Algorithms

The project currently supports the following pathfinding algorithms:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A\* Algorithm
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search
